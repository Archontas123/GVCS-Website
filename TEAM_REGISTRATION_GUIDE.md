```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Your code here
    return 0;
}
```

#### Java Submissions
- Class name must be `Solution`
- Use `public static void main(String[] args)`
- Read from `System.in`, write to `System.out`

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

#### Python Submissions
- Use `input()` for reading
- Use `print()` for output
- No special class or function requirements

```python
# Your code here
n = int(input())
print(n)
```
